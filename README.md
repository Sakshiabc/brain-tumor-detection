Brain tumor detection, segmentation using image thresholding (Solidity concept)

Conclusion= Thus segmented the tumor from given brain image using solidity area concept(image thresholding).
By choosing proper value of threshold we may mark tumor boundaries. The experiment is tested with different
view of the brain tumor image such as axial, coronal, segittal.
